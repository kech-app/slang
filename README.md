# Slang: Tools for designing and toying with DSLs. Targeting Elixir and Typescript

## Previous art:
**Lex & Yacc**: The OG from the 70's

**Xtext**: Great if you enjoy working within the Eclipse ecosystem. It's highly integrated and streamlined for Eclipse users, making it a pleasant experience if you're already comfortable in that environment.

**ANTLR**: Offers a powerful and flexible way to build parsers for custom languages. If you like diving deep into language parsing and grammar rules, ANTLR can be very satisfying to use.

**JetBrains MPS**: Known for its unique "projectional editing" approach, which allows you to work directly with the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) rather than plain text. If you're interested in innovative approaches to language design, MPS can be quite engaging.

**Racket**: Ideal if you're into Lisp-like languages and functional programming. It's especially fun if you're interested in language-oriented programming and enjoy the academic aspects of language design.

**Domain-Specific Language Toolkit (DSL-Toolkit)**: Being Python-based, it might be more accessible and quicker to get into, especially if you're already familiar with Python.

**Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)**: Good if you're into model-driven development and enjoy working with models and graphical editors.

## First paint strokes
I liked Lex & Yacc, ANTLR is a successor.
So ANTLR it is.
